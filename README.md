# TinyTapeout 2 4-bit by 4-bit multiplier

This is a submission for TinyTapeout 2 of a circuit that multiplies two 4-bit numbers provided on the input pins, and returns a 8-bit result on the outputs. It is implemented purely using combinatorial logic, so no clock or reset are required for it to function.
